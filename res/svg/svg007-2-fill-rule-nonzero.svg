	<!--
	fill-rule: nonzero:
		The value nonzero determines the "insideness" of a point in the shape by drawing a ray
		from that point to infinity in any direction, and then examining the places where
		a segment of the shape crosses the ray. Starting with a count of zero, add one each time
		a path segment crosses the ray from left to right and subtract one each time a path segment
		crosses the ray from right to left. After counting the crossings, if the result is zero then
		the point is outside the path. Otherwise, it is inside.

	fill-rule can be applied to <altGlyph>, <path>, <polygon>, <polyline>, <text>, <textPath>, <tref>, <tspan> )
